# PPyUtil

**Version:** 0.1

**Author:** Philipp Allgeuer

This repository contains general Python utilities that are useful across many projects.

## Python dependencies
The following Python packages should be available in order to make full use of PPyUtil:
```text
colored gitpython matplotlib pillow portalocker property_cached psutil pynvml unidecode
cv2  # e.g. opencv-python
```
If some of these packages are not available, then the parts of the library that need them won't work, but the rest of the library will continue to work.
